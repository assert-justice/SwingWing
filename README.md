Known Issues:

For reasons that are inscrutable to me the web version's leaderboard doesn't work. Just use the native version if you're competitive.

The scoring system has an exploit but I kind of like it. Mum's the word tho.

I would do some dark s*** for an explanation of how to use monospace fonts in Godot.
